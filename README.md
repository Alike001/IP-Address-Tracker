# IP Address Tracker

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See their own IP Address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location
- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
